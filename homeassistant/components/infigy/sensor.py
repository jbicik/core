# This file shows the setup for the sensors associated with the cover.
# They are setup in the same way with the call to the async_setup_entry function
# via HA from the module __init__. Each sensor has a device_class, this tells HA how
# to display it in the UI (for know types). The unit_of_measurement property tells HA
# what the unit is, so it can display the correct range. For predefined types (such as
# battery), the unit_of_measurement should match what's expected.
